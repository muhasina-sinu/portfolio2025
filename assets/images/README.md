# Placeholder Images Needed

Please add the following images to the `assets/images/` directory:

1. `profile-placeholder.jpg` - Your professional headshot (300x300px, circular crop recommended)
2. `about-placeholder.jpg` - An image representing your work or personality (400px width recommended)

You can use placeholder services like:
- https://picsum.photos/300/300 for profile-placeholder.jpg
- https://picsum.photos/400/300 for about-placeholder.jpg

Or replace with your actual photos.
